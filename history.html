        <p>It is believed that todayâ€™s Halloween customs are influenced by folk customs and beliefs from Celtic-speaking 
           countries, some of which are believed to have pagan roots. The historian Nicholas Rogers explores the origins 
           of Halloween, noting: "Although some folklorists have been discovered at the feast of Pomona in Rome, the 
           goddess of fruits and seeds, or on the festival of the dead called Parents' Day Its origin, but usually related 
           to the Samhain Celtic Festival, is derived from Old Irish, meaning "the end of summer." Samhain is the fourth in the 
           medieval Gaelic calendar The first day of the fractional day is also the most important day, and 
           was celebrated in Ireland, Scotland, and Isle of Man from October 31 to November 1. For the Celtics, the day ends at 
           sunset. Therefore, the music festival began on the evening of November 7 through modern calculations. Samhain and Calan Gaeaf 
           are mentioned in some of the earliest documents in Ireland and Wales. Until the 19th century, historians used these names to 
           refer to Celtic Halloween customs, which are still the Gaelic and Welsh names for Halloween.</p><br>

        <p> Samhain / Calan Gaeaf marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the "darker half" of the year. 
            This means that "soul" or "fairy" can enter the world more easily. Fairy means respected and feared, and people often 
            invoke the protection of God when approaching the house. At Samhain, people believes that it must be protected to ensure 
            that people and livestock survive in winter. Food and drink or some crops are dedicated to AosSed. It is said that the 
            souls of the deceased would visit their houses again to seek hospitality. The belief that the souls of the dead return 
            to their homes one night a year and must be appeased seems to have a long history and is found in many cultures around 
            the world. In some places, torches ignited by campfires are irradiated with sunlight around houses and fields to protect 
            them. Some people think that they mimic the sun and prevent the decline and darkness of winter.</p><br>

        <p> Since at least the 16th century, this festival has held mime performances in Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man and Wales. 
            This involves people wearing clothes (or in disguise) from house to house, usually reciting scriptures or songs in 
            exchange for food. It may initially be a tradition in which people imitated (or the soul of the dead) and accepted 
            sacrifices on their behalf, which is similar to the customs of the soul. Pretending to be these creatures or wearing 
            disguise can also protect yourself from these creatures. F. Marian McNeill suggested that ancient festivals include people 
            wearing spirit-appropriate costumes, marked (or blackened) with ashes removed from sacred campfires on their faces. In parts 
            of Wales, people dress up like scary creatures, called Grauchod. Elsewhere in Europe, mummy and horse-loving are part of 
            other festivals every year. Halloween costumes and mischiefs spread throughout the UK in the 20th century. Traditionally, 
            pranksters use hollowed radishes or mangel buns, often with grotesque faces as lanterns. Lanterns use a variety of lanterns 
            to represent the spirit, or to avoid evil. They were common in parts of the Irish and Scottish Highlands in the 19th century 
            and Somerset. In the 20th century, they spread to other parts of England and are commonly known as Jack Lanterns.</p>
