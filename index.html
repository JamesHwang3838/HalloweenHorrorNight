<p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic 
festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth 
century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated 
some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over 
time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive 
gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.</p>

<br><h1>Celebrate Halloween</h1>
<p>Halloween celebrations include costume parties where people dress as witches, ghosts, and animal figures 
associated with Halloween, or as fictitious characters from horror films, television shows or books. Costume parties 
are often held at people’s homes, a hired venue, or venues that are supposedly haunted.</p>

<p>Many schools around the world, including international schools, celebrate Halloween by hosting costume 
parades and award prizes for creative costumes. Schools also provide fun classroom activities such as bobbing for 
apples, Halloween-themed coloring or drawing contests, and other games associated with Halloween. Students also 
learn about the observance’s origins and history.</p>

<p>Many children dress in costumes and form groups that are accompanied by adults to embark on a 
trick-or-treating adventure. This activity involves children knocking on doors in their local neighborhood and 
requesting a trick or treat. Some people give out treats while others request a trick, which often involves children 
presenting a small joke or trick. Many homes are decorated to fit the Halloween theme during this period. 
Decorations include fake cobwebs, jack-o-lanterns and images of black cats or witches.</p>

<br><h1>Public Life</h1>
<p>Halloween is an observance in many countries and not a public holiday. It is observed in countries such as 
(but not exclusive to) Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<br><h1>About Halloween</h1>
<p>Halloween originated from the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain, which marked the start of winter and
 the start of the new year. It was believed that the spirits of the dead could return to the Earth around that time.</p>

<p>This date later became known as All Hallows’ Eve during early Christian times and was a time to pray for the 
 and honor the saints.</p>

<p>Many people participating in Halloween celebrations in modern times light candles in jack-o-lanterns rather 
than bonfires. Other elements of the Pagan celebration are retained, as Halloween is still a night to remember the 
spirits and other supernatural themes.</p>

<br><h1>Symbols</h1>
<p>There are many Halloween symbols. Symbols include animals, such as black cats, bats and spiders, and figures, 
such as ghosts, skeletons, witches and wizards. Pumpkins, graveyards, cobwebs, haunted houses and the colors green, 
orange, grey and black are also associated with Halloween. These symbols are used to decorate homes and party venues 
and are seen on costumes, gift paper, cards, cookies, cakes and candy.</p>
