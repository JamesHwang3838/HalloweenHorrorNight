<h3>DARK RIDE <small><small>(Horror level ☢☢☢)</small></small></h3>

    sinister shadows and horrifying scenes cast the gloom over the once pleasant ride. It’s everyone’s worst nightmare, being helplessly trapped inside an 
    abandoned carnival ride without a way out.</p>

    prowl the streets and inhabit the fog. Beware the notoriously startling Sliders who lunge from every fog-filled
    corner of the land. They wander their crypts preying on unsuspecting visitors, looking for victims to drag back.</p>
